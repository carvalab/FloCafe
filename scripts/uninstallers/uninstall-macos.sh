#!/bin/bash
# Flo Cafe — standalone macOS uninstaller
#
# Removes the Flo Cafe app and its support files (preferences, caches, logs,
# auto-update state). Your business data (SQLite database, backups, Master
# PIN) is only deleted if you say so: interactively, you'll be asked
# Delete or Keep; non-interactively, pass --purge-data to delete it or
# leave it out to keep it.
#
# Download and run directly, no need to clone the repo:
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/FloCafe/releases/latest/download/uninstall-macos.sh -o uninstall-macos.sh
#   chmod +x uninstall-macos.sh
#   ./uninstall-macos.sh
#
# Usage:
#   ./uninstall-macos.sh              Remove the app + support files; asks whether to also delete your data
#   ./uninstall-macos.sh --purge-data Also delete your database, backups, and Master PIN without asking (irreversible)
#   ./uninstall-macos.sh --dry-run    Show what would be removed without touching anything
